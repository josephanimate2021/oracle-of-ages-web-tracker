# The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages Tracker 
# (designed for GitHub Pages)
This is a tracker built entirely from vanila JavaScript that helps you track your progression as you play the game. As of right now, I am focusing on making this tracker work with the randomizer version of Ages 
as that's something that will priortize a tracker the most unlike just playing the normal game.

## Why does this tracker exist? There is already a PopTracker pack out there that perfectly tracks my items just fine.
Well, it does, but the PopTracker pack has so many critical bugs that affect it's usability for new players of the Oracle of Ages Randomizer like Auto Tabbing between maps not working when connected to Archipelago (The client has that feature), 
listed events not being checked off properly (The client has that as well), Dungeon entrances not appearing each time you enter a dungeon with Dungeon Shuffle on (Again, AP client has that), and so on. 
Refer to the video description of this [YouTube Video](https://youtu.be/aJCN1odTCIA) (made by me) so that you can see exactly what I mean. The map is on the bottom left corner of the video.
